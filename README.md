# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

In this Challenge we were tasked with cleaning up the html and css elements of some starter code in order to optimize code organization and accessibility. 

Organized code should have a logical flow when read, so cleaning up the code is important for both readability by the search engine and for other developers.

In this challenge we:
*added proper semantic elements in html section <!--for ex: footer section is under footer element as opposed to a division within the body-->
*consolidated css declarations <!--css declarations that repeated themselves were consolidated into their own classes for ex: .contentboxes>
*alt attributes were added to all imgs
*fixed navigation links in header
